# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

**1. Define Machien Learning**

Machine Learning is about building systems that can learn from data.<br/>
Learning means getting better at some task, given some performance measuermeasure.<br/>


**2. List out four types of problems that can be solved using it.**

**3. What is a labeled training set?**

**4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?**

**5. What are the four most common unsupervised tasks?**

**6. What type of Machine Learning algorithms would you use to allow a robot to walk
   in various unknown terrains?**
   
**7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?**

**8. Spam detection is in example of Supervised learning Or Unsupervised learning?**

**9. What is an online learning system?**

**10. What is out-of-core learning?**

**11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?**

**12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm's hyperparameter?**

**13. What do model-based learnign algorithms search for? What is the most commmon strategy
      they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?**
    
**14. Can you name four main challenges in Machine Learning?**

**15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances,
      What is happenning? Can you name three possible solutions?**
    
**16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?**

**17. What is the purpose of a validation set?**

**18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?**

**19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?**
