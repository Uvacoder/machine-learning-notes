- **Anomaly detection**<br/>
The system is shown mostly normal instances during training, os it learns to recognize them.<br/>
Then, when it sees a new instance, it can tell whether it looks like a normal one or whether it is likely an anomaly.


- **Assoicate Rule learning**<br/>
The goal is to dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relations between attributes.


- **Cost function**<br/>
Cost function measures how bad your model is.


- **Dimensionality reduction**<br/>
It is a task that simplifies the data without loosing too much information.<br/>
e.g., One wasy to do this is to merge several correlated features into one.


- **Feature extraction**<br/>
Feature extraction is identifying new feature from the existing set of features.<br/>
e.g., By combining multiple features into one using dimensionality reduction.


- **Fitness function**<br/>
Fitness function or Utility function measures how good your model is.


- **Hierarchical clusterin algorithm:**<br/>
It is an Unsupervised learning technique, It subdivides each group into smaller group.<br/>


- **Instance-based learning**<br/>
In this kind of learning, The system learns the example, then generalizes to new cases by using a similarity measure to compare them to the learned examples.


- **Novelty detection**<br/>
It aims to detect new instances that look different from all instances in the training set.


- **Offline learning(Batch learning)**<br/>
In batch learning, system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained using all the available data.<br/>
First the system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs wihout learning anymore.<br/>
It just applies what is has learned.


- **Online learning**<br/>
In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially,<br/>
either individually or in small groups called mini-batches.


- **Visualization Algorithms**<br/>
They are example of unsupervised learning, They take lots of complex and unlabeled data<br/>
And they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can be easily plotted.
